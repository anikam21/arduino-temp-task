# Arduino-temp-task

Name: Anika Marzia

#Overview 
This arduino code such that it lights up the RGB LED and Servo Motor depending on the temperature of the TMP36

The servo motor has its maximum and minimum angles mapped based on the Temperature sensor 

The colour of the RGB LED is based on the table below: 

#Components 
- Arduino Uno
- TMP36 Temperature Sensor 
- 4-Leg RGB LED
- 1 kiloohm Resistor 
- 3-Pin Servo Motor
